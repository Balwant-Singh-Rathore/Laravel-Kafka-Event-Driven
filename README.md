# Laravel Kafka Event-Driven 🚀

A repository demonstrating how to sync two databases using Kafka and Debezium CDC (Change Data Capture) process in a Laravel environment.

## 🌟 Overview

This repository showcases the implementation of an event-driven architecture to synchronize data between two databases using Apache Kafka and Debezium CDC. The system consists of the following components:

- 🚀 **Kafka**: A distributed event streaming platform that allows high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data processing.
- 🔀 **Debezium**: An open-source CDC platform that captures row-level changes from MySQL and publishes them to Kafka topics as events.
- ⚙️ **Laravel**: A powerful PHP framework for building web applications, used to consume and process the Kafka events.

## 📦 Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Apache Kafka
- Debezium Connector for MySQL
- PHP
